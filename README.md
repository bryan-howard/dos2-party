# dos2-party
Divinity: Original Sin 2 party saves

Clone this into the directory where steam puts saves for DoS2. Mine is

    ~/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/compatdata/435150/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/Larian Studios/Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition/PlayerProfiles/Bryan

Game should then be saved by overwriting the 'Party' saved game, and committed/pushed back to github.
